    <p>
      I graduated from Millersville University in December 2019 with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During the summer
      of my junior and senior years I interned as a full-stack software engineer, contributing to an enterprise scale web
      application that helps industrial contractors go paperless. I am currently a site reliability engineer supporting some of
      the United States' most well-known grocery retailers.
